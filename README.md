Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Coursera
==========================================

This repository contains R code for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data".

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code downloads and unzips all the required data before doing the analysis. 

If the data is already present it won't download the files again.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `averagesData.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
